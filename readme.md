## Compiling

You must have [the Java3D libraries](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138252.html) installed in order to compile this code.  Once you've done that, simply run:

`javac cpsc101/team3/scorefour/*.java`

You can then run the game using:

`java cpsc101.team3.scorefour.Referee`

If you'd just like to download and run the game without having to build it, instructions on how to do so are available at http://www.mlindgren.ca/blog/projects/score-four.

## How to Play

The object of the game is to create a straight line of 4 beads.  Lines may occur along any axis, or along the diagonal between any two axes.  Click on a peg to place a bead there.  Use the arrow keys to rotate the board.  See the included user manual document for more information.

## A Note on Code Quality

This project is made available publicly only as an historical curiosity.  As it is _literally_ Computer Science 101 code, it should neither be taken as an example of proper Java coding style, nor as an example of the present abilities of any of the team members.
